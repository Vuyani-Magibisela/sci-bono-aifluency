                    <h2>What Makes AI "Intelligent"?</h2>
                    <p>So, what makes AI 'intelligent'? At its core, AI is the intelligence demonstrated by software or machines in performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.</p>
                    
                    <p>These tasks can include recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions. For example, when you interact with Siri on your mobile phone, it is not exhibiting intelligence in the same way a human would.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rather, humans have programmed it to respond to certain prompts and execute functions, such as providing the latest weather update in your area or letting you know your local news.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of the test was not to see if the answer was correct. For example, when asking a question like "what is the sum of two plus two", Turing did not seek to assess if the answer would be four, but more specifically, to evaluate whether the respondent was a machine or a human.</p>

                        <h3>Turing's Goal</h3>
                        <p>When Turing created this test, he was trying to reach the point where it would no longer be possible to distinguish between responses from machines and humans, where machines would be able to respond with the same functionalities and nuances that human beings have.</p>

                    <p>AI has advanced significantly over the years and is increasingly present in our daily lives. Take for instance your interaction with social media apps, like Instagram. The app uses machine learning, a subset of AI, to determine the content to show you next based on your recent activity.</p>

                        <h3>AI vs. Fiction</h3>
                        <p>Even though AI is all around us, it can be portrayed inaccurately, a common occurrence in Hollywood films. Some films depict AI as having feelings or being superior to humans. Usually, these narratives serve to provoke thought rather than accurately represent how humans interact with AI.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>These representations are artistic interpretations and do not actually reflect AI's capabilities. So, while AI can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence, it is important to remember that it operates very differently from human intelligence.</p>
                    
                    <p>AI does not have consciousness, emotions, or the ability to understand context in the same way humans do. It is a tool created and controlled by humans, and its capabilities are limited to what it has been programmed to do.</p>
                    
                    <p>That is why it is so important to understand what AI is - it allows you to discern fact from fiction.</p>
